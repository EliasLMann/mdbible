# Chapter 10

1. The Lord called Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,
2. Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When any one of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of livestock from the herd or from the flock.
3. If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the Lord.
4. He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
5. Then he shall kill the bull before the Lord, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood and throw the blood against the sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
6. Then he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces,
7. and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
8. And Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar;
9. but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar, as a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
10. If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, he shall bring a male without blemish,
11. and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the Lord, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
12. And he shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar,
13. but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
14. If his offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or pigeons.
15. And the priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head and burn it on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
16. He shall remove its crop with its contents and cast it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes.
17. He shall tear it open by its wings, but shall not sever it completely. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

# Chapter 10

1. When anyone brings a grain offering as an offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour. He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it
2. and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense, and the priest shall burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
3. But the rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the Lord ’s food offerings.
4. When you bring a grain offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers smeared with oil.
5. And if your offering is a grain offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mixed with oil.
6. You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
7. And if your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
8. And you shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the Lord, and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
9. And the priest shall take from the grain offering its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
10. But the rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the Lord ’s food offerings.
11. No grain offering that you bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as a food offering to the Lord.
12. As an offering of firstfruits you may bring them to the Lord, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing aroma.
13. You shall season all your grain offerings with salt. You shall not let the salt of the covenant with your God be missing from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.
14. If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits fresh ears, roasted with fire, crushed new grain.
15. And you shall put oil on it and lay frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
16. And the priest shall burn as its memorial portion some of the crushed grain and some of the oil with all of its frankincense; it is a food offering to the Lord.

# Chapter 10

1. If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offers an animal from the herd, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord.
2. And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and kill it at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall throw the blood against the sides of the altar.
3. And from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as a food offering to the Lord, he shall offer the fat covering the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
4. and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
5. Then Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering, which is on the wood on the fire; it is a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
6. If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord is an animal from the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
7. If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the Lord,
8. lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it in front of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
9. Then from the sacrifice of the peace offering he shall offer as a food offering to the Lord its fat; he shall remove the whole fat tail, cut off close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails
10. and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
11. And the priest shall burn it on the altar as a food offering to the Lord.
12. If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord
13. and lay his hand on its head and kill it in front of the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar.
14. Then he shall offer from it, as his offering for a food offering to the Lord, the fat covering the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails
15. and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
16. And the priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering with a pleasing aroma. All fat is the Lord ’s.
17. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, in all your dwelling places, that you eat neither fat nor blood.

# Chapter 10

1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If anyone sins unintentionally in any of the Lord ’s commandments about things not to be done, and does any one of them,
3. if it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then he shall offer for the sin that he has committed a bull from the herd without blemish to the Lord for a sin offering.
4. He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord and lay his hand on the head of the bull and kill the bull before the Lord.
5. And the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting,
6. and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the Lord in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
7. And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the Lord that is in the tent of meeting, and all the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
8. And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall remove from it, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails
9. and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys
10. (just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ); and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
11. But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung —
12. all the rest of the bull —he shall carry outside the camp to a clean place, to the ash heap, and shall burn it up on a fire of wood. On the ash heap it shall be burned up.
13. If the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by the Lord ’s commandments ought not to be done, and they realize their guilt,
14. when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it in front of the tent of meeting.
15. And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the Lord, and the bull shall be killed before the Lord.
16. Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting,
17. and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord in front of the veil.
18. And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is in the tent of meeting before the Lord, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
19. And all its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar.
20. Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
21. And he shall carry the bull outside the camp and burn it up as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
22. When a leader sins, doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the commandments of the Lord his God ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,
23. or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish,
24. and shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering.
25. Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
26. And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
27. If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the Lord ’s commandments ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,
28. or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.
29. And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.
30. And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
31. And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasing aroma to the Lord. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
32. If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish
33. and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
34. Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
35. And all its fat he shall remove as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the Lord ’s food offerings. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.

# Chapter 10

1. If anyone sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall bear his iniquity;
2. or if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt;
3. or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt;
4. or if anyone utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these;
5. when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed,
6. he shall bring to the Lord as his compensation for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.
7. But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the Lord as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
8. He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it completely,
9. and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
10. Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
11. But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
12. And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, on the Lord ’s food offerings; it is a sin offering.
13. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.
14. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
15. If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the Lord, he shall bring to the Lord as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued in silver shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
16. He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
17. If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the Lord ’s commandments ought not to be done, though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.
18. He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent for a guilt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
19. It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before the Lord.

# Chapter 10

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. If anyone sins and commits a breach of faith against the Lord by deceiving his neighbor in a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or if he has oppressed his neighbor
3. or has found something lost and lied about it, swearing falsely —in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby —
4. if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found
5. or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.
6. And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent for a guilt offering.
7. And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty.
8. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
10. And the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them beside the altar.
11. Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
12. The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
13. Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
14. And this is the law of the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar.
15. And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
16. And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten unleavened in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
17. It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
18. Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your generations, from the Lord ’s food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.
19. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
20. This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the Lord on the day when he is anointed : a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
21. It shall be made with oil on a griddle. You shall bring it well mixed, in baked pieces like a grain offering, and offer it for a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
22. The priest from among Aaron’s sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the Lord as decreed forever. The whole of it shall be burned.
23. Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.
24. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
25. Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy.
26. The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
27. Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.
28. And the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
29. Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
30. But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned up with fire.

# Chapter 10

1. This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy.
2. In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar.
3. And all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
4. the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys.
5. The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the Lord; it is a guilt offering.
6. Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
7. The guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
8. And the priest who offers any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
9. And every grain offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.
10. And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.
11. And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the Lord.
12. If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour well mixed with oil.
13. With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread.
14. And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a gift to the Lord. It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings.
15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
16. But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.
17. But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.
18. If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
19. Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh,
20. but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the Lord ’s peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.
21. And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the Lord ’s peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.
22. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
23. Speak to the people of Israel, saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.
24. The fat of an animal that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it.
25. For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the Lord shall be cut off from his people.
26. Moreover, you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places.
27. Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.
28. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
29. Speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the Lord shall bring his offering to the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
30. His own hands shall bring the Lord ’s food offerings. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the Lord.
31. The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
32. And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.
33. Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion.
34. For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
35. This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the Lord ’s food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the Lord.
36. The Lord commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.
37. This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the ordination offering, and of the peace offering,
38. which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to bring their offerings to the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.

# Chapter 10

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread.
3. And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
5. And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing that the Lord has commanded to be done.
6. And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
7. And he put the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band.
8. And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
9. And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the Lord commanded Moses.
10. Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
11. And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
12. And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.
13. And Moses brought Aaron’s sons and clothed them with coats and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
14. Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
15. And he killed it, and Moses took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it to make atonement for it.
16. And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
17. But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
18. Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
19. And he killed it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
20. He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.
21. He washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering for the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
22. Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
23. And he killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
24. Then he presented Aaron’s sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar.
25. Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh,
26. and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh.
27. And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the Lord.
28. Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the Lord.
29. And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord. It was Moses ’ portion of the ram of ordination, as the Lord commanded Moses.
30. Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons ’ garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons ’ garments with him.
31. And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
32. And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.
33. And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you.
34. As has been done today, the Lord has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
35. At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the Lord has charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded.
36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord commanded by Moses.

# Chapter 10

1. On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
2. and he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.
3. And say to the people of Israel, Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,
4. and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the Lord will appear to you.
5. And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.
6. And Moses said, This is the thing that the Lord commanded you to do, that the glory of the Lord may appear to you.
7. Then Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the Lord has commanded.
8. So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
9. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
10. But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the Lord commanded Moses.
11. The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
12. Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
13. And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
14. And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
15. Then he presented the people’s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering, like the first one.
16. And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule.
17. And he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
18. Then he killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
19. But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver —
20. they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,
21. but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses commanded.
22. Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
24. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.

# Chapter 10

1. Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them.
2. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
3. Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what the Lord has said : Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.
5. So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
6. And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the Lord has kindled.
7. And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
8. And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying,
9. Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
10. You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
11. and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the Lord has spoken to them by Moses.
12. Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons : Take the grain offering that is left of the Lord ’s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
13. You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons ’ due, from the Lord ’s food offerings, for so I am commanded.
14. But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons ’ due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
15. The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the Lord, and it shall be yours and your sons ’ with you as a due forever, as the Lord has commanded.
16. Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
17. Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?
18. Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
19. And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the Lord have approved?
20. And when Moses heard that, he approved.
