1. The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
2. but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.
3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.
4. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
5. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6. for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
6. As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.

11. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.
12. Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.
13. The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.
14. And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.
15. Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

26. with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.
27. For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.
28. For it is you who light my lamp; the Lord my God lightens my darkness.

39. For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
40. You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
41. They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the Lord, but he did not answer them.
42. I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
43. You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
44. As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.
45. Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.
46. The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation —
47. the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,
48. who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.
49. For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations, and sing to your name.
50. Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.

23. You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!
24. For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his face from him, but has heard, when he cried to him.
25. From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will perform before those who fear him.
26. The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the Lord! May your hearts live forever!
27. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you.
28. For kingship belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.
29. All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep himself alive.
30. Posterity shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;
31. they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn, that he has done it.

1. Into Your Hand I Commit My Spirit To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. In you, O Lord, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; in your righteousness deliver me!
2. Incline your ear to me; rescue me speedily! Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me!
3. For you are my rock and my fortress; and for your name’s sake you lead me and guide me;
4. you take me out of the net they have hidden for me, for you are my refuge.
5. Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God.
6. I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the Lord.
7. I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, because you have seen my affliction; you have known the distress of my soul,
8. and you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place.
9. Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief; my soul and my body also.
10. For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away.
11. Because of all my adversaries I have become a reproach, especially to my neighbors, and an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street flee from me.
12. I have been forgotten like one who is dead; I have become like a broken vessel.
13. For I hear the whispering of many — terror on every side !— as they scheme together against me, as they plot to take my life.
14. But I trust in you, O Lord; I say, You are my God.
15. My times are in your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my persecutors!
16. Make your face shine on your servant; save me in your steadfast love!
17. O Lord, let me not be put to shame, for I call upon you; let the wicked be put to shame; let them go silently to Sheol.
18. Let the lying lips be mute, which speak insolently against the righteous in pride and contempt.
19. Oh, how abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for those who take refuge in you, in the sight of the children of mankind!
20. In the cover of your presence you hide them from the plots of men; you store them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.
21. Blessed be the Lord, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was in a besieged city.
22. I had said in my alarm, I am cut off from your sight. But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.
23. Love the Lord, all you his saints! The Lord preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.

3. For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
4. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer.
5. I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.
6. Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.
7. You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance.

15. he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds.
16. The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
17. The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue.
18. Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love,
19. that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine.
20. Our soul waits for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.

11. Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
12. What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good?

2. Take hold of shield and buckler and rise for my help!
3. Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, I am your salvation!
4. Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and disappointed who devise evil against me!
5. Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away!
6. Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them!
7. For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.
8. Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it! And let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it—to his destruction!
9. Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord, exulting in his salvation.
10. All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like you, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him?
11. Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I do not know.
12. They repay me evil for good; my soul is bereft.
13. But I, when they were sick — I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting; I prayed with head bowed on my chest.
14. I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; as one who laments his mother, I bowed down in mourning.
15. But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered; they gathered together against me; wretches whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing;
16. like profane mockers at a feast, they gnash at me with their teeth.
17. How long, O Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their destruction, my precious life from the lions!
18. I will thank you in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise you.
19. Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.
20. For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they devise words of deceit.
21. They open wide their mouths against me; they say, Aha, Aha! Our eyes have seen it!
22. You have seen, O Lord; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!
23. Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication, for my cause, my God and my Lord!
24. Vindicate me, O Lord, my God, according to your righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me!
25. Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, our heart’s desire! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
26. Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!
27. Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad and say evermore, Great is the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant!
28. Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness and of your praise all the day long.

# Chapter 61

1. How Precious Is Your Steadfast Love To the choirmaster. Of David, the servant of the Lord. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.
2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
3. The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.
4. He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil.
5. Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
6. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O Lord.
7. How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8. They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
9. For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light.
10. Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart!
11. Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.

8. Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
9. For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.
10. In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.
11. But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.
12. The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him,
13. but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.
14. The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright;
15. their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
16. Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.
17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
18. The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever;
19. they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance.
20. But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish —like smoke they vanish away.
21. The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;
22. for those blessed by the Lord shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
23. The steps of a man are established by the Lord, when he delights in his way;
24. though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the Lord upholds his hand.
25. I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.
26. He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing.
27. Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever.
28. For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
29. The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever.
30. The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.
31. The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.
32. The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death.
33. The Lord will not abandon him to his power or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.
34. Wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off.
35. I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree.
36. But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.
37. Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.
38. But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.
39. The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
40. The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.

1. Do Not Forsake Me, O Lord A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath!
2. For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.
3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
4. For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
5. My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness,
6. I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning.
7. For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
8. I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
9. O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
10. My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes — it also has gone from me.
11. My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off.
12. Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.
13. But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth.
14. I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.
15. But for you, O Lord, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.
16. For I said, Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!
17. For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me.
18. I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.
19. But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
20. Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good.

1. What Is the Measure of My Days? To the choirmaster : to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence.
2. I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse.
3. My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue :
4. O Lord, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!
5. Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath!
6. Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather!
7. And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you.
8. Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool!
9. I am mute; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it.
10. Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand.
11. When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath!
12. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers.
13. Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!

1. My Help and My Deliverer To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
2. He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
3. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.
4. Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie!
5. You have multiplied, O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
6. In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
7. Then I said, Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me:
8. I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.
9. I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O Lord.
10. I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
11. As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!
12. For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
13. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me!
14. Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
15. Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, Aha, Aha!
16. But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, Great is the Lord!
17. As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!

1. O Lord, Be Gracious to Me To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him;
2. the Lord protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.
3. The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health.
4. As for me, I said, O Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!
5. My enemies say of me in malice, When will he die, and his name perish?
6. And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
7. All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
8. They say, A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies.
9. Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
10. But you, O Lord, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them!
11. By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.
12. But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
13. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen. Book Two

1. Why Are You Cast Down, O My Soul? To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.
2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?
4. These things I remember, as I pour out my soul : how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.
5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation
6. and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
7. Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me.
8. By day the Lord commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
9. I say to God, my rock : Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
10. As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?
11. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.

3. Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling!
4. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.
5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.

# Chapter 61

1. Come to Our Help To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old :
2. you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
3. for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them.
4. You are my King, O God; ordain salvation for Jacob!
5. Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us.
6. For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
7. But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us.
8. In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever.
9. But you have rejected us and disgraced us and have not gone out with our armies.
10. You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil.
11. You have made us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations.
12. You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.
13. You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.
14. You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
15. All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
16. at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
17. All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant.
18. Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way;
19. yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.
20. If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
21. would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
22. Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
23. Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!
24. Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground.
26. Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love!

9. daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

11. and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him.
12. The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people.

10. Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
11. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

3. Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.
4. For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.
5. As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight.
6. Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.
7. By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.
8. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever.
9. We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.

1. Why Should I Fear in Times of Trouble? To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
2. both low and high, rich and poor together!
3. My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
4. I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.
5. Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,
6. those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
7. Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,
8. for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,
9. that he should live on forever and never see the pit.
10. For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.
11. Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names.
12. Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.
13. This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts.
14. Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell.
15. But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me.
16. Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.
17. For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.
18. For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed —and though you get praise when you do well for yourself—
19. his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light.
20. Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.

3. Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest.
4. He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people :
5. Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!
6. The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge!
7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
8. Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.
9. I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds.
10. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
11. I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine.
12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.
13. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
14. Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High,
15. and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.
16. But to the wicked God says : What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips?
17. For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.
18. If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.
19. You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
20. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.
21. These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.
22. Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver!
23. The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!

2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!
3. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
4. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.
5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
6. Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
8. Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
9. Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
11. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
12. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
13. Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
15. O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
16. For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
18. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;
19. then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.

2. Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.
3. You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right.
4. You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
5. But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.
6. The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
7. See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!
8. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.
9. I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.

2. God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
3. They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
4. Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
5. There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
6. Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.

2. O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
3. For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves.
4. Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
5. He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.
6. With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good.

1. Cast Your Burden on the Lord To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!
2. Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan,
3. because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me.
4. My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
5. Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
6. And I say, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
7. yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness;
8. I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest.
9. Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.
10. Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;
11. ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.
12. For it is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him.
13. But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.
14. We used to take sweet counsel together; within God’s house we walked in the throng.
15. Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.
16. But I call to God, and the Lord will save me.
17. Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice.
18. He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
19. God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, because they do not change and do not fear God.
20. My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant.
21. His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
22. Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
23. But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.

5. All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6. They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.
7. For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!
8. You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?
9. Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.

2. I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
3. He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!
4. My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts — the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
6. They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves.
7. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!
8. Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!

2. No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.
3. The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
4. They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
5. so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.
6. O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord!
7. Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.
8. Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.
9. Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!
10. The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.
11. Mankind will say, Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth.

4. for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake, come to meet me, and see!
5. You, Lord God of hosts, are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil.
6. Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
7. There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips — for Who, they think, will hear us?
8. But you, O Lord, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision.
9. O my Strength, I will watch for you, for you, O God, are my fortress.
10. My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
11. Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord, our shield!
12. For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
13. consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth.
14. Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
15. They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill.
16. But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.
17. O my Strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.

# Chapter 61

1. He Will Tread Down Our Foes To the choirmaster : according to Shushan Eduth. A Miktam of David; for instruction; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and when Joab on his return struck down twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us.
2. You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters.
3. You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.
4. You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow.
5. That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us!
6. God has spoken in his holiness : With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
7. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
8. Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.
9. Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
10. Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies.
11. Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!
12. With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.

# Chapter 61

1. Lead Me to the Rock To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer;
2. from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,
3. for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.
4. Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings!
5. For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
6. Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!
7. May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!
8. So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day.
