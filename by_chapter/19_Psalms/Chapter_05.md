# Chapter 5

1. The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
2. but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.
3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.
4. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
5. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6. for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

# Chapter 5

1. The Reign of the Lord ’s Anointed Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,
3. Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.
4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.
5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
6. As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.
7. I will tell of the decree : The Lord said to me, You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
9. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
10. Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
11. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

# Chapter 5

1. Save Me, O My God A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
2. many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God.
3. But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
4. I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill.
5. I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.
6. I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
7. Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
8. Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people!

# Chapter 5

1. Answer Me When I Call To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!
2. O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?
3. But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
4. Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent.
5. Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord.
6. There are many who say, Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!
7. You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.
8. In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.

# Chapter 5

1. Lead Me in Your Righteousness To the choirmaster : for the flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Lord; consider my groaning.
2. Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray.
3. O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.
4. For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.
5. The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.
6. You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
7. But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you.
8. Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
9. For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
10. Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
11. But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.
12. For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover him with favor as with a shield.
