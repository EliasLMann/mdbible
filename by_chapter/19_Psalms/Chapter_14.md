# Chapter 14

1. The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
2. but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.
3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.
4. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
5. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6. for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

1. The Reign of the Lord ’s Anointed Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,
3. Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.
4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.
5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,
6. As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.
7. I will tell of the decree : The Lord said to me, You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
9. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
10. Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
11. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

7. His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
8. He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;

10. The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might.
11. He says in his heart, God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it.

16. The Lord is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land.
17. O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear
