# Chapter 3

1. Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
2. To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours :
3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4. I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
5. that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge —
6. even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you —
7. so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
8. who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
10. I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
11. For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers.
12. What I mean is that each one of you says, I follow Paul, or I follow Apollos, or I follow Cephas, or I follow Christ.
13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
14. I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
15. so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
16. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else .)
17. For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
18. For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
19. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.
20. Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
21. For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.
22. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
23. but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
24. but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
25. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
26. For consider your calling, brothers : not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
27. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
28. God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
29. so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
30. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
31. so that, as it is written, Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.

# Chapter 3

1. And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
2. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
3. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling,
4. and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
5. so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
6. Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away.
7. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
8. None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
9. But, as it is written, What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him —
10. these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
11. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
12. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
13. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
14. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
15. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
16. For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

# Chapter 3

1. But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
2. I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
3. for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
4. For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, are you not being merely human?
5. What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
6. I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
7. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
8. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor.
9. For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, God’s building.
10. According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
11. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
12. Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw —
13. each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
14. If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
15. If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
16. Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?
17. If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.
18. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
19. For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their craftiness,
20. and again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.
21. So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
22. whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours,
23. and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.
