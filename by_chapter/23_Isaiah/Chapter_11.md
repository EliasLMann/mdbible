# Chapter 11

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
2. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken : Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.
3. The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.
4. Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.
5. Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
6. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil.
7. Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.
8. And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
9. If the Lord of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.
10. Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of, Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
11. What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
12. When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts?
13. Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations — I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
15. When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.
16. Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,
17. learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow’s cause.
18. Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord : though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
19. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;
20. but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
21. How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
22. Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water.
23. Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow’s cause does not come to them.
24. Therefore the Lord declares, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel : Ah, I will get relief from my enemies and avenge myself on my foes.
25. I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.
26. And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.
27. Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
28. But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.
29. For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.
30. For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.
31. And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.

# Chapter 11

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
2. It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,
3. and many peoples shall come, and say : Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
4. He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
5. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.
6. For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
7. Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.
8. Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
9. So man is humbled, and each one is brought low — do not forgive them!
10. Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of the Lord, and from the splendor of his majesty.
11. The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
12. For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up —and it shall be brought low;
13. against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
14. against all the lofty mountains, and against all the uplifted hills;
15. against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
16. against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
17. And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
18. And the idols shall utterly pass away.
19. And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the Lord, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
20. In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,
21. to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the Lord, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
22. Stop regarding man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?

# Chapter 11

1. For behold, the Lord God of hosts is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply, all support of bread, and all support of water;
2. the mighty man and the soldier, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,
3. the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms.
4. And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.
5. And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable.
6. For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule;
7. in that day he will speak out, saying : I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people.
8. For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord, defying his glorious presence.
9. For the look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
10. Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
11. Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for what his hands have dealt out shall be done to him.
12. My people — infants are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your guides mislead you and they have swallowed up the course of your paths.
13. The Lord has taken his place to contend; he stands to judge peoples.
14. The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people : It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
15. What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor? declares the Lord God of hosts.
16. The Lord said : Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet,
17. therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts.
18. In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;
19. the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves;
20. the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
21. the signet rings and nose rings;
22. the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;
23. the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
24. Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a skirt of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
25. Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle.
26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; empty, she shall sit on the ground.

# Chapter 11

1. And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach.
2. In that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel.
3. And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
4. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
5. Then the Lord will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy.
6. There will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.

# Chapter 11

1. Let me sing for my beloved my love song concerning his vineyard : My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
2. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.
3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
4. What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?
5. And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.
6. I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
7. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, an outcry!
8. Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.
9. The Lord of hosts has sworn in my hearing : Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
10. For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.
11. Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!
12. They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do not regard the deeds of the Lord, or see the work of his hands.
13. Therefore my people go into exile for lack of knowledge; their honored men go hungry, and their multitude is parched with thirst.
14. Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down, her revelers and he who exults in her.
15. Man is humbled, and each one is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.
16. But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.
17. Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture, and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.
18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin as with cart ropes,
19. who say : Let him be quick, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near, and let it come, that we may know it!
20. Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
21. Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!
22. Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,
23. who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!
24. Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
25. Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
26. He will raise a signal for nations far away, and whistle for them from the ends of the earth; and behold, quickly, speedily they come!
27. None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistband is loose, not a sandal strap broken;
28. their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses ’ hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.
29. Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey; they carry it off, and none can rescue.
30. They will growl over it on that day, like the growling of the sea. And if one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by its clouds.

# Chapter 11

1. In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.
2. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings : with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
3. And one called to another and said : Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!
4. And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
5. And I said : Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!
6. Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
7. And he touched my mouth and said : Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.
8. And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here I am! Send me.
9. And he said, Go, and say to this people : Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.
10. Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.
11. Then I said, How long, O Lord? And he said : Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste,
12. and the Lord removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
13. And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump.

# Chapter 11

1. In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.
2. When the house of David was told, Syria is in league with Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
3. And the Lord said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field.
4. And say to him, Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.
5. Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,
6. Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,
7. thus says the Lord God : It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.
9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all.
10. Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz,
11. Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.
12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.
13. And he said, Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?
14. Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
15. He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
16. For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted.
17. The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah —the king of Assyria.
18. In that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
19. And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.
20. In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River —with the king of Assyria —the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
21. In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
22. and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.
23. In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.
24. With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.
25. And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.

# Chapter 11

1. Then the Lord said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
2. And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.
3. And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
4. for before the boy knows how to cry My father or My mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.
5. The Lord spoke to me again :
6. Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
7. therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,
8. and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
9. Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered; give ear, all you far countries; strap on your armor and be shattered; strap on your armor and be shattered.
10. Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
11. For the Lord spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying :
12. Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
13. But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
14. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
15. And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.
16. Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples.
17. I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
18. Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
19. And when they say to you, Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?
20. To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.
21. They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.
22. And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.

# Chapter 11

1. But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
2. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.
3. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil.
4. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
5. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.
6. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
8. The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will fall on Israel;
9. and all the people will know, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart :
10. The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
11. But the Lord raises the adversaries of Rezin against him, and stirs up his enemies.
12. The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
13. The people did not turn to him who struck them, nor inquire of the Lord of hosts.
14. So the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day —
15. the elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;
16. for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
17. Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
18. For wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
19. Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is scorched, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no one spares another.
20. They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; each devours the flesh of his own arm,
21. Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh; together they are against Judah. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.

# Chapter 11

1. Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression,
2. to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
3. What will you do on the day of punishment, in the ruin that will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?
4. Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.
5. Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger; the staff in their hands is my fury!
6. Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
7. But he does not so intend, and his heart does not so think; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few;
8. for he says : Are not my commanders all kings?
9. Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
10. As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
11. shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her images?
12. When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.
13. For he says : By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I remove the boundaries of peoples, and plunder their treasures; like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.
14. My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing or opened the mouth or chirped.
15. Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!
16. Therefore the Lord God of hosts will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.
17. The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
18. The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the Lord will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
19. The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.
20. In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
21. A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
22. For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
23. For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.
24. Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts : O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.
25. For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.
26. And the Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
27. And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat.
28. He has come to Aiath; he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he stores his baggage;
29. they have crossed over the pass; at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled.
30. Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Give attention, O Laishah! O poor Anathoth!
31. Madmenah is in flight; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
32. This very day he will halt at Nob; he will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
33. Behold, the Lord God of hosts will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the great in height will be hewn down, and the lofty will be brought low.
34. He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by the Majestic One.

# Chapter 11

1. There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.
2. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
3. And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear,
4. but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.
5. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.
6. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them.
7. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
8. The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den.
9. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
10. In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples —of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.
11. In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea.
12. He will raise a signal for the nations and will assemble the banished of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
13. The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, and those who harass Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not harass Ephraim.
14. But they shall swoop down on the shoulder of the Philistines in the west, and together they shall plunder the people of the east. They shall put out their hand against Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites shall obey them.
15. And the Lord will utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt, and will wave his hand over the River with his scorching breath, and strike it into seven channels, and he will lead people across in sandals.
16. And there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant that remains of his people, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
