# Chapter 7

1. These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
2. These are the names of the sons of Aaron : Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3. These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests.
4. But Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.
5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.
7. They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, as they minister at the tabernacle.
8. They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle.
9. And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the people of Israel.
10. And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall guard their priesthood. But if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.
11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
12. Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,
13. for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast. They shall be mine: I am the Lord.
14. And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
15. List the sons of Levi, by fathers ’ houses and by clans; every male from a month old and upward you shall list.
16. So Moses listed them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded.
17. And these were the sons of Levi by their names : Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
18. And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans : Libni and Shimei.
19. And the sons of Kohath by their clans : Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
20. And the sons of Merari by their clans : Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, by their fathers ’ houses.
21. To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.
22. Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 7,500.
23. The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west,
24. with Eliasaph, the son of Lael as chief of the fathers ’ house of the Gershonites.
25. And the guard duty of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
26. the hangings of the court, the screen for the door of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords — all the service connected with these.

29. The clans of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
30. with Elizaphan the son of Uzziel as chief of the fathers ’ house of the clans of the Kohathites.
31. And their guard duty involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and the screen; all the service connected with these.
32. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the chiefs of the Levites, and to have oversight of those who kept guard over the sanctuary.
33. To Merari belonged the clan of the Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites : these are the clans of Merari.
34. Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 6,200.

36. And the appointed guard duty of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, the bars, the pillars, the bases, and all their accessories; all the service connected with these;
37. also the pillars around the court, with their bases and pegs and cords.
38. Those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, guarding the sanctuary itself, to protect the people of Israel. And any outsider who came near was to be put to death.
39. All those listed among the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron listed at the commandment of the Lord, by clans, all the males from a month old and upward, were 22,000.
40. And the Lord said to Moses, List all the firstborn males of the people of Israel, from a month old and upward, taking the number of their names.
41. And you shall take the Levites for me—I am the Lord — instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel.
42. So Moses listed all the firstborn among the people of Israel, as the Lord commanded him.
43. And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as listed were 22,273.
44. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
45. Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. The Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.
46. And as the redemption price for the 273 of the firstborn of the people of Israel, over and above the number of the male Levites,
47. you shall take five shekels per head; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel of twenty gerahs ),
48. and give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are over.
49. So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites.
50. From the firstborn of the people of Israel he took the money, 1,365 shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.
51. And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.

4. This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting : the most holy things.
5. When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it.

And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting that the sons of Kohath are to carry.
16. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering, and the anointing oil, with the oversight of the whole tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels.
17. The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
18. Let not the tribe of the clans of the Kohathites be destroyed from among the Levites,
19. but deal thus with them, that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things : Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden,
20. but they shall not go in to look on the holy things even for a moment, lest they die.
21. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

# Chapter 7

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Command the people of Israel that they put out of the camp everyone who is leprous or has a discharge and everyone who is unclean through contact with the dead.
3. You shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell.
4. And the people of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the Lord said to Moses, so the people of Israel did.
5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
6. Speak to the people of Israel, When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the Lord, and that person realizes his guilt,
7. he shall confess his sin that he has committed. And he shall make full restitution for his wrong, adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong.
8. But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the Lord for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him.
9. And every contribution, all the holy donations of the people of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
10. Each one shall keep his holy donations : whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his.
11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
12. Speak to the people of Israel, If any man’s wife goes astray and breaks faith with him,
13. if a man lies with her sexually, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, since she was not taken in the act,
14. and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself,
15. then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
16. And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the Lord.
17. And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
18. And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord and unbind the hair of the woman’s head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
19. Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband’s authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse.
20. But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,
21. then (let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse, and say to the woman ) the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.
22. May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
23. Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
24. And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.
25. And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the grain offering before the Lord and bring it to the altar.
26. And the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
27. And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
28. But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.
29. This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, though under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
30. or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.
31. The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.

# Chapter 7

1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the Lord,
3. he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.
4. All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.
5. All the days of his vow of separation, no razor shall touch his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the Lord, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long.
6. All the days that he separates himself to the Lord he shall not go near a dead body.
7. Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.
8. All the days of his separation he is holy to the Lord.
9. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
10. On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
11. and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall consecrate his head that same day
12. and separate himself to the Lord for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. But the previous period shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
13. And this is the law for the Nazirite, when the time of his separation has been completed : he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
14. and he shall bring his gift to the Lord, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace offering,
15. and a basket of unleavened bread, loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their grain offering and their drink offerings.
16. And the priest shall bring them before the Lord and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering,
17. and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering.
18. And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.
19. And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the hair of his consecration,
20. and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord. They are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
21. This is the law of the Nazirite. But if he vows an offering to the Lord above his Nazirite vow, as he can afford, in exact accordance with the vow that he takes, then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite.
22. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
23. Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel : you shall say to them,
24. The Lord bless you and keep you;
25. the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
26. the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.
27. So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.
