# Chapter 13

1. These are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
2. These are the names of the sons of Aaron : Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3. These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests.
4. But Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.
5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.
7. They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, as they minister at the tabernacle.
8. They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle.
9. And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the people of Israel.
10. And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall guard their priesthood. But if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.
11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
12. Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,
13. for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast. They shall be mine: I am the Lord.
14. And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
15. List the sons of Levi, by fathers ’ houses and by clans; every male from a month old and upward you shall list.
16. So Moses listed them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded.
17. And these were the sons of Levi by their names : Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
18. And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans : Libni and Shimei.
19. And the sons of Kohath by their clans : Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
20. And the sons of Merari by their clans : Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, by their fathers ’ houses.
21. To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites.
22. Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 7,500.
23. The clans of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west,
24. with Eliasaph, the son of Lael as chief of the fathers ’ house of the Gershonites.
25. And the guard duty of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the entrance of the tent of meeting,
26. the hangings of the court, the screen for the door of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords — all the service connected with these.
27. To Kohath belonged the clan of the Amramites and the clan of the Izharites and the clan of the Hebronites and the clan of the Uzzielites; these are the clans of the Kohathites.
28. According to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, keeping guard over the sanctuary.
29. The clans of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
30. with Elizaphan the son of Uzziel as chief of the fathers ’ house of the clans of the Kohathites.
31. And their guard duty involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and the screen; all the service connected with these.
32. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the chiefs of the Levites, and to have oversight of those who kept guard over the sanctuary.
33. To Merari belonged the clan of the Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites : these are the clans of Merari.
34. Their listing according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was 6,200.
35. And the chief of the fathers ’ house of the clans of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
36. And the appointed guard duty of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, the bars, the pillars, the bases, and all their accessories; all the service connected with these;
37. also the pillars around the court, with their bases and pegs and cords.
38. Those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, guarding the sanctuary itself, to protect the people of Israel. And any outsider who came near was to be put to death.
39. All those listed among the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron listed at the commandment of the Lord, by clans, all the males from a month old and upward, were 22,000.
40. And the Lord said to Moses, List all the firstborn males of the people of Israel, from a month old and upward, taking the number of their names.
41. And you shall take the Levites for me—I am the Lord — instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel.
42. So Moses listed all the firstborn among the people of Israel, as the Lord commanded him.
43. And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as listed were 22,273.
44. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
45. Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. The Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.
46. And as the redemption price for the 273 of the firstborn of the people of Israel, over and above the number of the male Levites,
47. you shall take five shekels per head; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel of twenty gerahs ),
48. and give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are over.
49. So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites.
50. From the firstborn of the people of Israel he took the money, 1,365 shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.
51. And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Chapter 13

2. Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their clans and their fathers ’ houses,
3. from thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who can come on duty, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
4. This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting : the most holy things.
5. When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it.
6. Then they shall put on it a covering of goatskin and spread on top of that a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.

15. And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting that the sons of Kohath are to carry.
16. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering, and the anointing oil, with the oversight of the whole tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels.
17. The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
18. Let not the tribe of the clans of the Kohathites be destroyed from among the Levites,
19. but deal thus with them, that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things : Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden,
20. but they shall not go in to look on the holy things even for a moment, lest they die.
21. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
22. Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers ’ houses and by their clans.
23. From thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall list them, all who can come to do duty, to do service in the tent of meeting.

26. and the hangings of the court and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service. And they shall do all that needs to be done with regard to them.
27. All the service of the sons of the Gershonites shall be at the command of Aaron and his sons, in all that they are to carry and in all that they have to do. And you shall assign to their charge all that they are to carry.

# Chapter 13

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Command the people of Israel that they put out of the camp everyone who is leprous or has a discharge and everyone who is unclean through contact with the dead.
3. You shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell.
4. And the people of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the Lord said to Moses, so the people of Israel did.
5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
6. Speak to the people of Israel, When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the Lord, and that person realizes his guilt,
7. he shall confess his sin that he has committed. And he shall make full restitution for his wrong, adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong.
8. But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the Lord for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him.
9. And every contribution, all the holy donations of the people of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
10. Each one shall keep his holy donations : whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his.
11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
12. Speak to the people of Israel, If any man’s wife goes astray and breaks faith with him,
13. if a man lies with her sexually, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, since she was not taken in the act,
14. and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself,
15. then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
16. And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the Lord.
17. And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
18. And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord and unbind the hair of the woman’s head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
19. Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband’s authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse.
20. But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,
21. then (let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse, and say to the woman ) the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.
22. May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
23. Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
24. And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.
25. And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the grain offering before the Lord and bring it to the altar.
26. And the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
27. And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
28. But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.
29. This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, though under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
30. or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.
31. The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.

# Chapter 13

1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the Lord,
3. he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.
4. All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.
5. All the days of his vow of separation, no razor shall touch his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the Lord, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long.
6. All the days that he separates himself to the Lord he shall not go near a dead body.
7. Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.
8. All the days of his separation he is holy to the Lord.
9. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
10. On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
11. and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall consecrate his head that same day
12. and separate himself to the Lord for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. But the previous period shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
13. And this is the law for the Nazirite, when the time of his separation has been completed : he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
14. and he shall bring his gift to the Lord, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace offering,
15. and a basket of unleavened bread, loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their grain offering and their drink offerings.
16. And the priest shall bring them before the Lord and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering,
17. and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering.
18. And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.
19. And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the hair of his consecration,
20. and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord. They are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
21. This is the law of the Nazirite. But if he vows an offering to the Lord above his Nazirite vow, as he can afford, in exact accordance with the vow that he takes, then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite.
22. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
23. Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel : you shall say to them,
24. The Lord bless you and keep you;
25. the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
26. the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.
27. So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.

# Chapter 13

1. On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,
2. the chiefs of Israel, heads of their fathers ’ houses, who were the chiefs of the tribes, who were over those who were listed, approached
3. and brought their offerings before the Lord, six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the chiefs, and for each one an ox. They brought them before the tabernacle.
4. Then the Lord said to Moses,
5. Accept these from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.
6. So Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.

8. And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

# Chapter 13

1. Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.
3. And Aaron did so : he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the Lord commanded Moses.
4. And this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the Lord had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
6. Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them.
7. Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them : sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.
8. Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering.
9. And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel.
10. When you bring the Levites before the Lord, the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,
11. and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the Lord.
12. Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the Lord to make atonement for the Levites.
13. And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to the Lord.
14. Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
15. And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering.
16. For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself.
17. For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,
18. and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.
19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Israel, that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary.
20. Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them.
21. And the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
22. And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
23. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
24. This applies to the Levites : from twenty-five years old and upward they shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting.
25. And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more.
26. They minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties.

# Chapter 13

1. And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2. Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
3. On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.
4. So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
5. And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
6. And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
7. And those men said to him, We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the Lord ’s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?
8. And Moses said to them, Wait, that I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you.
9. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
10. Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the Lord.
11. In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
12. They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.
13. But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the Lord ’s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
14. And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the Lord, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.
15. On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
16. So it was always : the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
17. And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
18. At the command of the Lord the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the Lord they camped. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
19. Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the Lord and did not set out.
20. Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the Lord they remained in camp; then according to the command of the Lord they set out.
21. And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
22. Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.
23. At the command of the Lord they camped, and at the command of the Lord they set out. They kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of the Lord by Moses.

# Chapter 13

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.
3. And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4. But if they blow only one, then the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
5. When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out.
6. And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
7. But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm.
8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
9. And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the Lord your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
10. On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God : I am the Lord your God.
11. In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony,
12. and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
13. They set out for the first time at the command of the Lord by Moses.
14. The standard of the camp of the people of Judah set out first by their companies, and over their company was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
15. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
16. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
17. And when the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, set out.
18. And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their companies, and over their company was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
19. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
20. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
21. Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.
22. And the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
23. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
24. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
25. Then the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
26. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
27. And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
28. This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out.
29. And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses ’ father-in-law, We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the Lord has promised good to Israel.
30. But he said to him, I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.
31. And he said, Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us.
32. And if you do go with us, whatever good the Lord will do to us, the same will we do to you.
33. So they set out from the mount of the Lord three days ’ journey. And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them three days ’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
34. And the cloud of the Lord was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp.
35. And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you.
36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.

# Chapter 13

1. And the people complained in the hearing of the Lord about their misfortunes, and when the Lord heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
2. Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire died down.
3. So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the Lord burned among them.
4. Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also wept again and said, Oh that we had meat to eat!
5. We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
6. But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.
7. Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
8. The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
9. When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
10. Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.
11. Moses said to the Lord, Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
12. Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child, to the land that you swore to give their fathers?
13. Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, Give us meat, that we may eat.
14. I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.
15. If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.
16. Then the Lord said to Moses, Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
17. And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.
18. And say to the people, Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the Lord, saying, Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt. Therefore the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat.
19. You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
20. but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the Lord who is among you and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come out of Egypt?
21. But Moses said, The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!
22. Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?
23. And the Lord said to Moses, Is the Lord ’s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.
24. So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.
25. Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.
26. Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
27. And a young man ran and told Moses, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, My lord Moses, stop them.
29. But Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord ’s people were prophets, that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!
30. And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
31. Then a wind from the Lord sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground.
32. And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
33. While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord struck down the people with a very great plague.
34. Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.
35. From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.

# Chapter 13

1. Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
2. And they said, Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also? And the Lord heard it.
3. Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
4. And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting. And the three of them came out.
5. And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
6. And he said, Hear my words : If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.
7. Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
8. With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
9. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he departed.
10. When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
12. Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.
13. And Moses cried to the Lord, O God, please heal her—please.
14. But the Lord said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.
15. So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
16. After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.

# Chapter 13

1. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2. Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.
3. So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the Lord, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.
4. And these were their names : From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
5. from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
6. from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
7. from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
8. from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
9. from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
10. from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
11. from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh ), Gaddi the son of Susi;
12. from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
13. from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
14. from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
15. from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
16. These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
17. Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country,
18. and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
19. and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
20. and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
21. So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.
22. They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. ( Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt .)
23. And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs.
24. That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.
25. At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
26. And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
27. And they told him, We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
28. However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
29. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.
30. But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.
31. Then the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.
32. So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height.
33. And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim ), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.
