# Chapter 24

1. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
2. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
3. And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
4. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.
5. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
6. And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.
7. And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.
8. And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
9. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.
10. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
11. And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth. And it was so.
12. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
13. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
14. And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years,
15. and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.
16. And God made the two great lights —the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night —and the stars.
17. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
18. to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
20. And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.
21. So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
23. And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds — livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so.
25. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
26. Then God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
27. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
28. And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
29. And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food.
30. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.
31. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

# Chapter 24

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2. And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
3. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
4. These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
5. When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up— for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,
6. and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground —
7. then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
8. And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
9. And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
10. A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
11. The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
12. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
13. The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
14. And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
15. The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
16. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
17. but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
18. Then the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.
19. Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
20. The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.
21. So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
22. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
23. Then the man said, This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
24. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
25. And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.

# Chapter 24

1. Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, Did God actually say, You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?
2. And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
3. but God said, You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.
4. But the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die.
5. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
6. So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
7. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
8. And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
9. But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?
10. And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.
11. He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
12. The man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.
13. Then the Lord God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
14. The Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
15. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
16. To the woman he said, I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.
17. And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, You shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
18. thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
19. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
20. The man called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
21. And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
22. Then the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever —
23. therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
24. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.

# Chapter 24

1. Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord.
2. And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
3. In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground,
4. and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering,
5. but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
6. The Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
7. If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.
8. Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
9. Then the Lord said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?
10. And the Lord said, What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground.
11. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
12. When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.
13. Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
14. Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.
15. Then the Lord said to him, Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.
16. Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
17. Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
18. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
19. And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
20. Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
21. His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
22. Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
23. Lamech said to his wives : Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say : I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
24. If Cain’s revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech’s is seventy-sevenfold.
25. And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.
26. To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the Lord.

# Chapter 24

1. This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.
2. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.
3. When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
4. The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.
5. Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died.
6. When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh.
7. Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
8. Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.
9. When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan.
10. Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
11. Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.
12. When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel.
13. Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
14. Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.
15. When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared.
16. Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
17. Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died.
18. When Jared had lived 162 years he fathered Enoch.
19. Jared lived after he fathered Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
20. Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.
21. When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah.
22. Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
23. Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years.
24. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.
25. When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech.
26. Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
27. Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.
28. When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son
29. and called his name Noah, saying, Out of the ground that the Lord has cursed, this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.
30. Lamech lived after he fathered Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
31. Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.
32. After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

# Chapter 24

1. When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them,
2. the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.
3. Then the Lord said, My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh : his days shall be 120 years.
4. The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.
5. The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6. And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
7. So the Lord said, I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.
8. But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.
10. And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
11. Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
12. And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
13. And God said to Noah, I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14. Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
15. This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
16. Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.
17. For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
18. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons ’ wives with you.
19. And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
20. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.
21. Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.
22. Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.

# Chapter 24

1. Then the Lord said to Noah, Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.
2. Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,
3. and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
4. For in seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.
5. And Noah did all that the Lord had commanded him.
6. Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
7. And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons ’ wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
8. Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
9. two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
10. And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
11. In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
12. And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
13. On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,
14. they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.
15. They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
16. And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And the Lord shut him in.
17. The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
18. The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
19. And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
20. The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
21. And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.
22. Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
23. He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
24. And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.

# Chapter 24

1. But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.
2. The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
3. and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated,
4. and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
5. And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
6. At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
7. and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
8. Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.
9. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
10. He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
11. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
12. Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.
13. In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
14. In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.
15. Then God said to Noah,
16. Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons ’ wives with you.
17. Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh — birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth —that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.
18. So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons ’ wives with him.
19. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.
20. Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
21. And when the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma, the Lord said in his heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.

# Chapter 24

1. And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
2. The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.
3. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
4. But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
5. And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning : from every beast I will require it and from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
6. Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.
7. And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.
8. Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
9. Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,
10. and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.
11. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.
12. And God said, This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations :
13. I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
14. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
15. I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16. When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.
17. God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.
18. The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. ( Ham was the father of Canaan .)
19. These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed.
20. Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.
21. He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.
22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
23. Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
24. When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
25. he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.
26. He also said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be his servant.
27. May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.
28. After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
29. All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.

# Chapter 24

1. These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
2. The sons of Japheth : Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
3. The sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
4. The sons of Javan : Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
5. From these the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.
6. The sons of Ham : Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
7. The sons of Cush : Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah : Sheba and Dedan.
8. Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man.
9. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. Therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord.
10. The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
11. From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and
12. Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
13. Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
14. Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came ), and Caphtorim.
15. Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth,
16. and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
17. the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
18. the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.
19. And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
20. These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
21. To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
22. The sons of Shem : Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
23. The sons of Aram : Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
24. Arpachshad fathered Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.
25. To Eber were born two sons : the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother’s name was Joktan.
26. Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
27. Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
28. Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29. Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
30. The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east.
31. These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
32. These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.

1. Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
2. And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
3. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
4. Then they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.
5. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.
6. And the Lord said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
7. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.
8. So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
9. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth. And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
10. These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was 100 years old, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
11. And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
12. When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah.
13. And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
14. When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.
15. And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
16. When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg.
17. And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
18. When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu.
19. And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
20. When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug.
21. And Reu lived after he fathered Serug 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
22. When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor.
23. And Serug lived after he fathered Nahor 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
24. When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah.
25. And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
26. When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
27. Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
28. Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
29. And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
30. Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
31. Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
32. The days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died in Haran.

# Chapter 24

1. Now the Lord said to Abram, Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.
2. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
3. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
4. So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
6. Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
7. Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, To your offspring I will give this land. So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
8. From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord.
9. And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
10. Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
11. When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,
12. and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, This is his wife. Then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
13. Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.
14. When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
15. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
16. And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
17. But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
18. So Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
19. Why did you say, She is my sister, so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.
20. And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.

# Chapter 24

1. So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
2. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
3. And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
4. to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord.
5. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
6. so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
7. and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
8. Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.
9. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.
10. And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah .)
11. So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
12. Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
13. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord.
14. The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
15. for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
16. I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
17. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.
18. So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.

# Chapter 24

1. In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
2. these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar ).
3. And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim ( that is, the Salt Sea ).
4. Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
5. In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
6. and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
7. Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh ) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar.
8. Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar ) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
9. with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
10. Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
11. So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
12. They also took Lot, the son of Abram’s brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
13. Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
14. When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
15. And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
16. Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.
17. After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley ).
18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High .)
19. And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;
20. and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.
22. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
23. that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich.
24. I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.

# Chapter 24

1. After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision : Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.
2. But Abram said, O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
3. And Abram said, Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.
4. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.
5. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them. Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.
6. And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
7. And he said to him, I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.
8. But he said, O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess it?
9. He said to him, Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10. And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.
11. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
12. As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
13. Then the Lord said to Abram, Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.
14. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
15. As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
16. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.
17. When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
18. On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
19. the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
20. the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
21. the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.

# Chapter 24

1. Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar.
2. And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
3. So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
4. And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
5. And Sarai said to Abram, May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me!
6. But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please. Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
7. The angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
8. And he said, Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going? She said, I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.
9. The angel of the Lord said to her, Return to your mistress and submit to her.
10. The angel of the Lord also said to her, I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.
11. And the angel of the Lord said to her, Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the Lord has listened to your affliction.
12. He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.
13. So she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You are a God of seeing, for she said, Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.
14. Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
15. And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
16. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

# Chapter 24

1. When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,
2. that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.
3. Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,
4. Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
5. No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
6. I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you.
7. And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
8. And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.
9. And God said to Abraham, As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
10. This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
11. You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
12. He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,
13. both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
14. Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.
15. And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
16. I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.
17. Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?
18. And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before you!
19. God said, No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
20. As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.
21. But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.
22. When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
23. Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
24. Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
25. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26. That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
27. And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

# Chapter 24

1. And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.
2. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
3. and said, O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
4. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree,
5. while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on — since you have come to your servant. So they said, Do as you have said.
6. And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.
7. And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.
8. Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
9. They said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.
10. The Lord said, I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
12. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?
13. The Lord said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh and say, Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?
14. Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.
15. But Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. He said, No, but you did laugh.
16. Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
17. The Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
18. seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
19. For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.
20. Then the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave,
21. I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.
22. So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord.
23. Then Abraham drew near and said, Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
24. Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
25. Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?
26. And the Lord said, If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.
27. Abraham answered and said, Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
28. Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.
29. Again he spoke to him and said, Suppose forty are found there. He answered, For the sake of forty I will not do it.
30. Then he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there. He answered, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
31. He said, Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there. He answered, For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.
32. Then he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there. He answered, For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.
33. And the Lord went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

# Chapter 24

1. The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
2. and said, My lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way. They said, No; we will spend the night in the town square.
3. But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.
5. And they called to Lot, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.
6. Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,
7. and said, I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
8. Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.
9. But they said, Stand back! And they said, This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them. Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
10. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
11. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
12. Then the men said to Lot, Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place.
13. For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.
14. So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, Up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
15. As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.
16. But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
17. And as they brought them out, one said, Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.
18. And Lot said to them, Oh, no, my lords.
19. Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
20. Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there —is it not a little one ?—and my life will be saved!
21. He said to him, Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
22. Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
23. The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
24. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
26. But Lot’s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
27. And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
28. And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
29. So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
30. Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
31. And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.
33. So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
34. The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.
35. So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
36. Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
37. The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
38. The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.

# Chapter 24

1. From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.
4. Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
5. Did he not himself say to me, She is my sister? And she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.
6. Then God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
7. Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.
8. So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
9. Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.
10. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you did this thing?
11. Abraham said, I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
12. Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
13. And when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.
14. Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.
16. To Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.
17. Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
18. For the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

# Chapter 24

1. The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised.
2. And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.
3. Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
5. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
6. And Sarah said, God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.
7. And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.
8. And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
9. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.
10. So she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.
11. And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
12. But God said to Abraham, Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
13. And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.
14. So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
15. When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
16. Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, Let me not look on the death of the child. And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
17. And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
18. Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.
19. Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
20. And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow.
21. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
22. At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, God is with you in all that you do.
23. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.
24. And Abraham said, I will swear.
25. When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized,
26. Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.
27. So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
28. Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
29. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?
30. He said, These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.
31. Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.
32. So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
33. Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.
34. And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.

# Chapter 24

1. After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Here I am.
2. He said, Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
3. So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
4. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
5. Then Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.
6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
7. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, My father! And he said, Here I am, my son. He said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8. Abraham said, God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they went both of them together.
9. When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
10. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
11. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here I am.
12. He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.
13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
14. So Abraham called the name of that place, The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.
15. And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven
16. and said, By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
17. I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies,
18. and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.
19. So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.
20. Now after these things it was told to Abraham, Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor :
21. Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
22. Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
23. ( Bethuel fathered Rebekah .) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
24. Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

# Chapter 24

1. Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
2. And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron ) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
3. And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites,
4. I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
5. The Hittites answered Abraham,
6. Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.
7. Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
8. And he said to them, If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
9. that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.
10. Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,
11. No, my lord, hear me : I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.
12. Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
13. And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.
14. Ephron answered Abraham,
15. My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.
16. Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
17. So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
18. to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
19. After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron ) in the land of Canaan.
20. The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.

# Chapter 24

1. Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
2. And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, Put your hand under my thigh,
3. that I may make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,
4. but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
5. The servant said to him, Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?
6. Abraham said to him, See to it that you do not take my son back there.
7. The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, To your offspring I will give this land, he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
8. But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.
9. So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
10. Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.
11. And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
12. And he said, O Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
13. Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
14. Let the young woman to whom I shall say, Please let down your jar that I may drink, and who shall say, Drink, and I will water your camels —let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.
15. Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.
16. The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
17. Then the servant ran to meet her and said, Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.
18. She said, Drink, my lord. And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
19. When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.
20. So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.
21. The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not.
22. When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
23. and said, Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?
24. She said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
25. She added, We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.
26. The man bowed his head and worshiped the Lord
27. and said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the Lord has led me in the way to the house of my master’s kinsmen.
28. Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
29. Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring.
30. As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, Thus the man spoke to me, he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
31. He said, Come in, O blessed of the Lord. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.
32. So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
33. Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have said what I have to say. He said, Speak on.
34. So he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
35. The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys.
36. And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has.
37. My master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,
38. but you shall go to my father’s house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.
39. I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.
40. But he said to me, The Lord, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father’s house.
41. Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.
42. I came today to the spring and said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go,
43. behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,
44. and who will say to me, Drink, and I will draw for your camels also, let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son.
45. Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, Please let me drink.
46. She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also. So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
47. Then I asked her, Whose daughter are you? She said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him. So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
48. Then I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son.
49. Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing has come from the Lord; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
51. Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.
52. When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the Lord.
53. And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
54. And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, Send me away to my master.
55. Her brother and her mother said, Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.
56. But he said to them, Do not delay me, since the Lord has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
57. They said, Let us call the young woman and ask her.
58. And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? She said, I will go.
59. So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men.
60. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your offspring possess the gate of those who hate him!
61. Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
62. Now Isaac had returned from Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.
64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel
65. and said to the servant, Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us? The servant said, It is my master. So she took her veil and covered herself.
66. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
67. Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
