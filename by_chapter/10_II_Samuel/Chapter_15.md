# Chapter 15

1. After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
2. And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage.
3. David said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I have escaped from the camp of Israel.
4. And David said to him, How did it go? Tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.
5. Then David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?
6. And the young man who told him said, By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
7. And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.
8. And he said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
9. And he said to me, Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.
10. So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.
11. Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.
12. And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
13. And David said to the young man who told him, Where do you come from? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
14. David said to him, How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the Lord ’s anointed?
15. Then David called one of the young men and said, Go, execute him. And he struck him down so that he died.
16. And David said to him, Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, I have killed the Lord ’s anointed.
17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,
18. and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:
19. Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
20. Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
21. You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields of offerings! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
22. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
23. Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles; they were stronger than lions.
24. You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
25. How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
26. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
27. How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

# Chapter 15

1. After this David inquired of the Lord, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said to him, Go up. David said, To which shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.
2. So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
3. And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron.
4. And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When they told David, It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,
5. David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, May you be blessed by the Lord, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him.
6. Now may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing.
7. Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.
8. But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim,
9. and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel.
10. Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
11. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
12. Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
13. And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
14. And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men arise and compete before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
15. Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
16. And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon.
17. And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
18. And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle.
19. And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
20. Then Abner looked behind him and said, Is it you, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.
21. Abner said to him, Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
22. And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?
23. But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
24. But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
25. And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill.
26. Then Abner called to Joab, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?
27. And Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.
28. So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.
29. And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim.
30. Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David’s servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
31. But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner’s men.
32. And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.

# Chapter 15

1. There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
2. And sons were born to David at Hebron : his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
3. and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
4. and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
5. and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
6. While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
7. Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?
8. Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, Am I a dog’s head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.
9. God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the Lord has sworn to him,
10. to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.
11. And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
12. And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you.
13. And he said, Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.
14. Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
15. And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.
16. But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, Go, return. And he returned.
17. And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
18. Now then bring it about, for the Lord has promised David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.
19. Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
20. When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
21. And Abner said to David, I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
22. Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
23. When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.
24. Then Joab went to the king and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?
25. You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.
26. When Joab came out from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it.
27. And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
28. Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the Lord for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
29. May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father’s house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!
30. So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
31. Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner. And King David followed the bier.
32. They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
33. And the king lamented for Abner, saying, Should Abner die as a fool dies?
34. Your hands were not bound; your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen. And all the people wept again over him.
35. Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!
36. And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people.
37. So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s will to put to death Abner the son of Ner.
38. And the king said to his servants, Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
39. And I was gentle today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!

# Chapter 15

1. When Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
2. Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Beeroth ( for Beeroth also is counted part of Benjamin;
3. the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day ).
4. Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
5. Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest.
6. And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
7. When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night,
8. and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The Lord has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.
9. But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
10. when one told me, Behold, Saul is dead, and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
11. How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?
12. And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.

# Chapter 15

1. Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
2. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.
3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel.
4. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
5. At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
6. And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off — thinking, David cannot come in here.
7. Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
8. And David said on that day, Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul. Therefore it is said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
9. And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
10. And David became greater and greater, for the Lord, the God of hosts, was with him.
11. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.
12. And David knew that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
13. And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
14. And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
15. Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
16. Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
17. When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
18. Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
19. And David inquired of the Lord, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand? And the Lord said to David, Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.
20. And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. And he said, The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood. Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
21. And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
22. And the Philistines came up yet again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
23. And when David inquired of the Lord, he said, You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
24. And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then rouse yourself, for then the Lord has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.
25. And David did as the Lord commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.

# Chapter 15

1. David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2. And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim.
3. And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart,
4. with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.
5. And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the Lord, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.
6. And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
7. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God.
8. And David was angry because the Lord had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day.
9. And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and he said, How can the ark of the Lord come to me?
10. So David was not willing to take the ark of the Lord into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
11. And the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
12. And it was told King David, The Lord has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing.
13. And when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.
14. And David danced before the Lord with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod.
15. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the horn.
16. As the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart.
17. And they brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
18. And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts
19. and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed, each to his house.
20. And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants ’ female servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
21. And David said to Michal, It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the Lord —and I will celebrate before the Lord.
22. I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes. But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor.
23. And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.

# Chapter 15

1. Now when the king lived in his house and the Lord had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
2. the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.
3. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you.
4. But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan,
5. Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord : Would you build me a house to dwell in?
6. I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling.
7. In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
8. Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.
9. And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
10. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
11. from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house.
12. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
13. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
14. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
15. but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
16. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.
17. In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
18. Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
19. And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord God. You have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord God!
20. And what more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Lord God!
21. Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have brought about all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
22. Therefore you are great, O Lord God. For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
23. And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name and doing for them great and awesome things by driving out before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods?
24. And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O Lord, became their God.
25. And now, O Lord God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.
26. And your name will be magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts is God over Israel, and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
27. For you, O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, I will build you a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
28. And now, O Lord God, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
29. Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord God, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever.

# Chapter 15

1. After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
2. And he defeated Moab and he measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground. Two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
3. David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the river Euphrates.
4. And David took from him 1,700 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left enough for 100 chariots.
5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians.
6. Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
7. And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
8. And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took very much bronze.
9. When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer,
10. Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold, and of bronze.
11. These also King David dedicated to the Lord, together with the silver and gold that he dedicated from all the nations he subdued,
12. from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
13. And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
14. Then he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
15. So David reigned over all Israel. And David administered justice and equity to all his people.
16. Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder,
17. and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary,
18. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David’s sons were priests.

# Chapter 15

1. And David said, Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
2. Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, I am your servant.
3. And the king said, Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? Ziba said to the king, There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet.
4. The king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
5. Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
6. And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, Mephibosheth! And he answered, Behold, I am your servant.
7. And David said to him, Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always.
8. And he paid homage and said, What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?
9. Then the king called Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s grandson.
10. And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master’s grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s grandson shall always eat at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
11. Then Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do. So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table, like one of the king’s sons.
12. And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba’s house became Mephibosheth’s servants.
13. So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate always at the king’s table. Now he was lame in both his feet.

# Chapter 15

1. After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
2. And David said, I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me. So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites.
3. But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?
4. So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away.
5. When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.
6. When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob, 12,000 men.
7. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men.
8. And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
9. When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
10. The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
11. And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
12. Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
13. So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
14. And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
15. But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
16. And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates. They came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
17. And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him.
18. And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
19. And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.

# Chapter 15

1. , In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
2. It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king’s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
3. And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
4. So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. ( Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness .) Then she returned to her house.
5. And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, I am pregnant.
6. So David sent word to Joab, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
7. When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going.
8. Then David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and wash your feet. And Uriah went out of the king’s house, and there followed him a present from the king.
9. But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
10. When they told David, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?
11. Uriah said to David, The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
12. Then David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
13. And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
14. In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
15. In the letter he wrote, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.
16. And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
17. And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died.
18. Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting.
19. And he instructed the messenger, When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,
20. then, if the king’s anger rises, and if he says to you, Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
21. Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
22. So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
23. The messenger said to David, The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
24. Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
25. David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it. And encourage him.
26. When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband.
27. And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.

# Chapter 15

1. And the Lord sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
2. The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
3. but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him.
4. Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.
5. Then David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die,
6. and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
7. Nathan said to David, You are the man! Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
8. And I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.
9. Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
10. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
11. Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
12. For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.
13. David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
14. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.
15. Then Nathan went to his house. And the Lord afflicted the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and he became sick.
16. David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.
17. And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
18. On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.
19. But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? They said, He is dead.
20. Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.
21. Then his servants said to him, What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.
22. He said, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
23. But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
24. Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the Lord loved him
25. and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord.
26. Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
27. And Joab sent messengers to David and said, I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.
28. Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.
29. So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.
30. And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
31. And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

# Chapter 15

1. Now Absalom, David’s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David’s son, loved her.
2. And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
3. But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
4. And he said to him, O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
5. Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.
6. So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
7. Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go to your brother Amnon’s house and prepare food for him.
8. So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
9. And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send out everyone from me. So everyone went out from him.
10. Then Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
11. But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
12. She answered him, No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing.
13. As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.
14. But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
15. Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Get up! Go!
16. But she said to him, No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.
17. He called the young man who served him and said, Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.
18. Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
19. And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
20. And her brother Absalom said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart. So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom’s house.
21. When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
22. But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.
23. After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
24. And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.
25. But the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
26. Then Absalom said, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?
27. But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
28. Then Absalom commanded his servants, Mark when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Strike Amnon, then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.
29. So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
30. While they were on the way, news came to David, Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.
31. Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.
32. But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
33. Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king’s sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.
34. But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
35. And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king’s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.
36. And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
37. But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.
38. So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
39. And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.

# Chapter 15

1. Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart went out to Absalom.
2. And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
3. Go to the king and speak thus to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
4. When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, Save me, O king.
5. And the king said to her, What is your trouble? She answered, Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
6. And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
7. And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed. And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.
8. Then the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.
9. And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father’s house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.
10. The king said, If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.
11. Then she said, Please let the king invoke the Lord your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed. He said, As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.
12. Then the woman said, Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king. He said, Speak.
13. And the woman said, Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.
14. We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast.
15. Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
16. For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.
17. And your servant thought, The word of my lord the king will set me at rest, for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The Lord your God be with you!
18. Then the king answered the woman, Do not hide from me anything I ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king speak.
19. The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? The woman answered and said, As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.
20. In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.
21. Then the king said to Joab, Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.
22. And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.
23. So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
24. And the king said, Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence. So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king’s presence.
25. Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
26. And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king’s weight.
27. There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.
28. So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king’s presence.
29. Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.
30. Then he said to his servants, See, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
31. Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
32. Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent word to you, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.
33. Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.

# Chapter 15

1. After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2. And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, From what city are you? And when he said, Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,
3. Absalom would say to him, See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.
4. Then Absalom would say, Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.
5. And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
6. Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
7. And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron.
8. For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the Lord.
9. The king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.
10. But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, Absalom is king at Hebron!
11. With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing.
12. And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.
13. And a messenger came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.
14. Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
15. And the king’s servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.
16. So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house.
17. And the king went out, and all the people after him. And they halted at the last house.
18. And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.
19. Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home.
20. You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.
21. But Ittai answered the king, As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be.
22. And David said to Ittai, Go then, pass on. So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
23. And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.
24. And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city.
25. Then the king said to Zadok, Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place.
26. But if he says, I have no pleasure in you, behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.
27. The king also said to Zadok the priest, Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
28. See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.
29. So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
30. But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.
31. And it was told David, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Lord, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
32. While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head.
33. David said to him, If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
34. But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant, then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
35. Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
36. Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.
37. So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
