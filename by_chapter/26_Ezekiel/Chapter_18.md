# Chapter 18

1. In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
2. On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin ),
3. the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal, and the hand of the Lord was upon him there.
4. As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal.
5. And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance : they had a human likeness,
6. but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
7. Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf’s foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze.
8. Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
9. their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went.
10. As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
11. Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.
12. And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.
13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
14. And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
15. Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
16. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction : their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
17. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went.
18. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
20. Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
21. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
22. Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads.
23. And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. And each creature had two wings covering its body.
24. And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
25. And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
26. And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance.
27. And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.
28. Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

# Chapter 18

1. And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.
2. And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
3. And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
4. The descendants also are impudent and stubborn : I send you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord God.
5. And whether they hear or refuse to hear ( for they are a rebellious house ) they will know that a prophet has been among them.
6. And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
7. And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house.
8. But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.
9. And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.
10. And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.

# Chapter 18

1. And he said to me, Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
2. So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
3. And he said to me, Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it. Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
4. And he said to me, Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.
5. For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel —
6. not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
7. But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
8. Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
9. Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
10. Moreover, he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
11. And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord God, whether they hear or refuse to hear.
12. Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake : Blessed be the glory of the Lord from its place!
13. It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake.
14. The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the Lord being strong upon me.
15. And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
16. And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me:
17. Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
18. If I say to the wicked, You shall surely die, and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
19. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
20. Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand.
21. But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.
22. And the hand of the Lord was upon me there. And he said to me, Arise, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you.
23. So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the Chebar canal, and I fell on my face.
24. But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.
25. And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
26. And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.
27. But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord God. He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.

# Chapter 18

1. And you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.
2. And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.
3. And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
4. Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment.
5. For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel.
6. And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
7. And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
8. And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.
9. And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it.
10. And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it.
11. And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from day to day you shall drink.
12. And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung.
13. And the Lord said, Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.
14. Then I said, Ah, Lord God! Behold, I have never defiled myself. From my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has tainted meat come into my mouth.
15. Then he said to me, See, I assign to you cow’s dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread.
16. Moreover, he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay.
17. I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and rot away because of their punishment.

# Chapter 18

1. And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber’s razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair.
2. A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
3. And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
4. And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
5. Thus says the Lord God : This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
6. And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes.
7. Therefore thus says the Lord God : Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, and have not even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you,
8. therefore thus says the Lord God : Behold, I, even I, am against you. And I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations.
9. And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.
10. Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds.
11. Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord God, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
12. A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
13. Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the Lord —that I have spoken in my jealousy — when I spend my fury upon them.
14. Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by.
15. You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes — I am the Lord; I have spoken —
16. when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread.
17. I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the Lord; I have spoken.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
3. and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys : Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
4. Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
5. And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
6. Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
7. And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
8. Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,
9. then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations.
10. And they shall know that I am the Lord. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.
11. Thus says the Lord God : Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
12. He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
13. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols.
14. And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the Lord.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel : An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
3. Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
4. And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
5. Thus says the Lord God : Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes.
6. An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.
7. Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains.
8. Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
9. And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord, who strikes.
10. Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
11. Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them.
12. The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
13. For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.
14. They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
15. The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour.
16. And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
17. All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
18. They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.
19. They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity.
20. His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them.
21. And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it.
22. I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.
23. Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence.
24. I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned.
25. When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
26. Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders.
27. The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

# Chapter 18

1. In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there.
2. Then I looked, and behold, a form that had the appearance of a man. Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal.
3. He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
4. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.
5. Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.
6. And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.
7. And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
8. Then he said to me, Son of man, dig in the wall. So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
9. And he said to me, Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here.
10. So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
11. And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
12. Then he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.
13. He said also to me, You will see still greater abominations that they commit.
14. Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
15. Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these.
16. And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.
17. Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose.
18. Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

# Chapter 18

1. Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.
2. And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
3. Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
4. And the Lord said to him, Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.
5. And to the others he said in my hearing, Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
6. Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were before the house.
7. Then he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out. So they went out and struck in the city.
8. And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, Ah, Lord God! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?
9. Then he said to me, The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For they say, The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see.
10. As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their deeds upon their heads.
11. And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, I have done as you commanded me.

# Chapter 18

1. Then I looked, and behold, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne.
2. And he said to the man clothed in linen, Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.
3. Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
4. And the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.
5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
6. And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, he went in and stood beside a wheel.
7. And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
8. The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
9. And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl.
10. And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
11. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without turning as they went.
12. And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around —the wheels that the four of them had.
13. As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.
14. And every one had four faces : the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
15. And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the Chebar canal.
16. And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.
17. When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
18. Then the glory of the Lord went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
19. And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
20. These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal; and I knew that they were cherubim.
21. Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the likeness of human hands.
22. And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal. Each one of them went straight forward.

# Chapter 18

1. The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
2. And he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
3. who say, The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.
4. Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
5. And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and he said to me, Say, Thus says the Lord : So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.
6. You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
7. Therefore thus says the Lord God : Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
8. You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord God.
9. And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.
10. You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
11. This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
12. and you shall know that I am the Lord. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.
13. And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, Ah, Lord God! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
14. And the word of the Lord came to me:
15. Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Go far from the Lord; to us this land is given for a possession.
16. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God : Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.
17. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God : I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
18. And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
19. And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
20. that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
21. But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord God.
22. Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
23. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
24. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
25. And I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are a rebellious house.
3. As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile’s baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
4. You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
5. In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
6. In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.
7. And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
8. In the morning the word of the Lord came to me:
9. Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?
10. Say to them, Thus says the Lord God : This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.
11. Say, I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.
12. And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
13. And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
14. And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
15. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
16. But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the Lord.
17. And the word of the Lord came to me:
18. Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety.
19. And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord God concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel : They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay. In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
20. And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the Lord.
21. And the word of the Lord came to me:
22. Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing?
23. Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord God : I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision.
24. For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
25. For I am the Lord; I will speak the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord God.
26. And the word of the Lord came to me:
27. Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.
28. Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God : None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord God.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts : Hear the word of the Lord!
3. Thus says the Lord God, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
4. Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel.
5. You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the Lord.
6. They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, Declares the Lord, when the Lord has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word.
7. Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, Declares the Lord, although I have not spoken?
8. Therefore thus says the Lord God : Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord God.
9. My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord God.
10. Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, Peace, when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash,
11. say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out.
12. And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, Where is the coating with which you smeared it?
13. Therefore thus says the Lord God : I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end.
14. And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
15. Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,
16. the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord God.
17. And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them
18. and say, Thus says the Lord God : Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?
19. You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.
20. Therefore thus says the Lord God : Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds.
21. Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
22. Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,
23. therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the Lord.

# Chapter 18

1. Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
2. And the word of the Lord came to me:
3. Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
4. Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord God : Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,
5. that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.
6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God : Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
7. For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the Lord will answer him myself.
8. And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
9. And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
10. And they shall bear their punishment —the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike—
11. that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord God.
12. And the word of the Lord came to me:
13. Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
14. even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord God.
15. If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,
16. even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord God, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
17. Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, Let a sword pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast,
18. though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord God, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
20. even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord God, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness.
21. For thus says the Lord God : How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
22. But behold, some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
23. They will console you, when you see their ways and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord God.

# Chapter 18

1. And the word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
3. Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
4. Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
5. Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
6. Therefore thus says the Lord God : Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7. And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them.
8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord God.

# Chapter 18

1. Again the word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
3. and say, Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem : Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
4. And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born.
6. And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! I said to you in your blood, Live!
7. I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.
8. When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord God, and you became mine.
9. Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
10. I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
11. And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
12. And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
13. Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
14. And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord God.
15. But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore because of your renown and lavished your whorings on any passerby; your beauty became his.
16. You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be.
17. You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore.
18. And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
19. Also my bread that I gave you— I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey —you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord God.
20. And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter
21. that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
22. And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood.
23. And after all your wickedness ( woe, woe to you! declares the Lord God ),
24. you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square.
25. At the head of every street you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring.
26. You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger.
27. Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
28. You played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied.
29. You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied.
30. How sick is your heart, declares the Lord God, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute,
31. building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
32. Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
33. Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings.
34. So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different.
35. Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the Lord :
36. Thus says the Lord God, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
37. therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
38. And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
39. And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare.
40. They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
41. And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more.
42. So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry.
43. Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord God. Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?
44. Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: Like mother, like daughter.
45. You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
46. And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
47. Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
48. As I live, declares the Lord God, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
49. Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom : she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.
50. They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it.
51. Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed.
52. Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
53. I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst,
54. that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them.
55. As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state.
56. Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,
57. before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you.
58. You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the Lord.
59. For thus says the Lord God : I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,
60. yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant.
61. Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you.
62. I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord,
63. that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord God.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
3. say, Thus says the Lord God : A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
4. He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
5. Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,
6. and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.
7. And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
8. It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
9. Say, Thus says the Lord God : Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
10. Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it— wither away on the bed where it sprouted?
11. Then the word of the Lord came to me:
12. Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
13. And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath ( the chief men of the land he had taken away ),
14. that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
15. But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?
16. As I live, declares the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
17. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
18. He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
19. Therefore thus says the Lord God : As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
20. I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me.
21. And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that I am the Lord; I have spoken.
22. Thus says the Lord God : I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
23. On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord; I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it.

# Chapter 18

1. The word of the Lord came to me:
2. What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?
3. As I live, declares the Lord God, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
4. Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die.
5. If a man is righteous and does what is just and right —
6. if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,
7. does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
8. does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice, executes true justice between man and man,
9. walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully —he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord God.
10. If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
11. (though he himself did none of these things ), who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife,
12. oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,
13. lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.
14. Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise :
15. he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife,
16. does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
17. withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father’s iniquity; he shall surely live.
18. As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
19. Yet you say, Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father? When the son has done what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.
20. The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
21. But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
22. None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
23. Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?
24. But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.
25. Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not just. Hear now, O house of Israel : Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
26. When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
27. Again, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
28. Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
29. Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not just. O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord God. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.
31. Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?
32. For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord God; so turn, and live.
