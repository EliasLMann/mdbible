# Chapter 7

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
4. who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
5. For as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
6. If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.
7. Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.
8. For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.
9. Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
10. He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.
11. You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.
12. For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.
13. For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand —
14. just as you did partially understand us — that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.
15. Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace.
16. I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.
17. Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say Yes, yes and No, no at the same time?
18. As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.
19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes.
20. For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.
21. And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us,
22. and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
23. But I call God to witness against me —it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth.
24. Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.

# Chapter 7

1. For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.
2. For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
3. And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.
4. For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
5. Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure — not to put it too severely —to all of you.
6. For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,
7. so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
8. So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
9. For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.
10. Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,
11. so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.
12. When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,
13. my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
14. But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.
15. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,
16. to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
17. For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God’s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.

# Chapter 7

1. Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
2. You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all.
3. And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
4. Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
5. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God,
6. who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
7. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses ’ face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
8. will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
9. For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
10. Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
11. For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
12. Since we have such a hope, we are very bold,
13. not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
14. But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
15. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.
16. But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
17. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
18. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.

# Chapter 7

1. Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart.
2. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God’s word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.
3. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
4. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
5. For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus ’ sake.
6. For God, who said, Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
7. But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
8. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
9. persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
10. always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.
11. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus ’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
12. So death is at work in us, but life in you.
13. Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, I believed, and so I spoke, we also believe, and so we also speak,
14. knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.
15. For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
16. So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.
17. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,
18. as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

# Chapter 7

1. For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2. For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling,
3. if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked.
4. For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened — not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
5. He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
6. So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,
7. for we walk by faith, not by sight.
8. Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
9. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.
10. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
11. Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
12. We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.
13. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
14. For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this : that one has died for all, therefore all have died;
15. and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
16. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
17. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
18. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
19. that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
20. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
21. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

# Chapter 7

1. Working together with him, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
2. For he says, In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you. Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
3. We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
4. but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,
5. beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
6. by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love;
7. by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
8. through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;
9. as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed;
10. as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.
11. We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open.
12. You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.
13. In return (I speak as to children ) widen your hearts also.
14. Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
15. What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
16. What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
17. Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,
18. and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.

# Chapter 7

1. Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.
2. Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.
3. I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
4. I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.
5. For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn— fighting without and fear within.
6. But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
7. and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.
8. For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it— though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while.
9. As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.
10. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.
11. For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter.
12. So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.
13. Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
14. For whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proved true.
15. And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
16. I rejoice, because I have complete confidence in you.
