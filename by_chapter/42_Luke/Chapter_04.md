# Chapter 4

1. Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us,
2. just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us,
3. it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
4. that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.
5. In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
6. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.
7. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.
8. Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,
9. according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
12. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
13. But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
14. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,
15. for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
16. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,
17. and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.
18. And Zechariah said to the angel, How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.
19. And the angel answered him, I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
20. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
21. And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.
22. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute.
23. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.
24. After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,
25. Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.
26. In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
28. And he came to her and said, Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!
29. But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
30. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
31. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
32. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,
33. and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.
34. And Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I am a virgin?
35. And the angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy— the Son of God.
36. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
37. For nothing will be impossible with God.
38. And Mary said, Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
39. In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah,
40. and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
41. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
42. and she exclaimed with a loud cry, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
43. And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
44. For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
45. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.
46. And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,
47. and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
48. for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
49. for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
50. And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.
51. He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;
52. he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate;
53. he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.
54. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,
55. as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.
56. And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.
57. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
58. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
59. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,
60. but his mother answered, No; he shall be called John.
61. And they said to her, None of your relatives is called by this name.
62. And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called.
63. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, His name is John. And they all wondered.
64. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.
65. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea,
66. and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.
67. And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
68. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people
69. and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,
70. as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
71. that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;
72. to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,
73. the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us
74. that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,
75. in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
76. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
77. to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins,
78. because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
79. to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
80. And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

# Chapter 4

1. In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
2. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
3. And all went to be registered, each to his own town.
4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
5. to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.
6. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.
7. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
8. And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
9. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.
10. And the angel said to them, Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
11. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
12. And this will be a sign for you : you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.
13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!
15. When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.
16. And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.
17. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child.
18. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them.
19. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.
20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.
21. And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
22. And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
23. ( as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord )
24. and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
25. Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
26. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
27. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law,
28. he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
29. Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;
30. for my eyes have seen your salvation
31. that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
32. a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.
33. And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.
34. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
35. ( and a sword will pierce through your own soul also ), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.
36. And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin,
37. and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.
38. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
39. And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
40. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.
41. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
42. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.
43. And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,
44. but supposing him to be in the group they went a day’s journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances,
45. and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.
46. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
47. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
48. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.
49. And he said to them, Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?
50. And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.
51. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.

# Chapter 4

1. In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
2. during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
3. And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
4. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways,
6. and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
7. He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
8. Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
9. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
10. And the crowds asked him, What then shall we do?
11. And he answered them, Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.
12. Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?
13. And he said to them, Collect no more than you are authorized to do.
14. Soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.
15. As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,
16. John answered them all, saying, I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
17. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
18. So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.
19. But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
20. added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.
21. Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,
22. and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.
23. Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph, the son of Heli,
24. the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
25. the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
26. the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
27. the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
28. the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
29. the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
30. the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
31. the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
32. the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon,
33. the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
34. the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
35. the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
36. the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
37. the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
38. the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

# Chapter 4

1. And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness
2. for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry.
3. The devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
4. And Jesus answered him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.
5. And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,
6. and said to him, To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.
7. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.
8. And Jesus answered him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
9. And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
10. for it is written, He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,
11. and On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
12. And Jesus answered him, It is said, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.
13. And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.
14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country.
15. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
16. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read.
17. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,
18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
19. to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.
20. And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
21. And he began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.
22. And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
23. And he said to them, Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself. What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.
24. And he said, Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
25. But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,
26. and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
27. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.
28. When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.
29. And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.
30. But passing through their midst, he went away.
31. And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath,
32. and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority.
33. And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
34. Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God.
35. But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.
36. And they were all amazed and said to one another, What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!
37. And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
38. And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother -in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf.
39. And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.
40. Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
41. And demons also came out of many, crying, You are the Son of God! But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
42. And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them,
43. but he said to them, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose.
44. And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
